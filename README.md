# Power-BI

There are 3 main ways to use Python on Power BI:

1 - Importing Data:
Using libraries like Pandas allows you to import data from csv or excel files. You can also use other libraries to import real time data from the web.

2 - Power Query Editor:
You can use the "Python script" option in Power Query to apply Python code to your data transformation process. Remember that the Python code executed in Power Query operates on data transformation and may not provide real-time interaction with visuals.

3 - Custom Visuals:
You can create custom visuals using Python libraries and then integrate them into Power BI. Libraries such as "plotly" or "matplotlib" that can create interactive visualizations. Would be advisable to develop these visuals outside Power BI and then import them into your report to make sure they work.
